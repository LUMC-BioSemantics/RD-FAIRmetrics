### Maturity Indicator Identifier: RD-R1 [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/RD-FAIRmetrics/main/metrics/RD-R1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/RD-FAIRmetrics/main/metrics/RD-R1)

### Maturity Indicator Name: Use of Rare Disease (RD) specific ORDO or HPO ontologies in the metadata
----

### To which principle does it apply?  
R1

### What is being measured?
Pointers in the metadata document to ORDO or HPO terms

### Why should we measure it?
Metadata that does not comply with the ORDO or HPO specific RD standards, will often render to a ‘reuseless’ dataset by the RD community because information about its content is missing.

### What must be provided for the measurement?
The Metadata GUID.


### How is the measurement executed?



### What is/are considered valid result(s)?



### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
RD digital resources

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)


### Comments
This test assesses the presence of RD specific ontologies used by the EJP RD community.
